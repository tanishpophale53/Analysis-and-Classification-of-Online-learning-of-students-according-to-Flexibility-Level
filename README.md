# Analysis-and-Classification-of-Online-learning-of-students-according-to-Flexibility-Level

Let say an edtech company wants to start its courses for students and wondering in which mode they should start online or offline?

So, this project named Flexibility Level Analysis & Classificaton of students encountering during Online Learning can help the company to take a quick decision in selecting of mode of training.

Flexibility is given as- LOW. MODERATE, HIGH
     
In short, we are categorizing the students review of online learning in the form of Flexibility(LOW, MODERATE, HIGH) by applying various classification algorithms like SVM, Decision Tree, XG Boost, ADA Boost, Random Forest, LGM, etc.

So, we got the highest accuracy by Decision Tree Classifier which is 85.4 %.
