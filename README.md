# Analysis-and-Classification-of-Online-learning-of-students-according-to-Flexibility-Level

In this project, we have done the Flexibility Level Analysis & Classificaton of students encountering during Online Learning.

Flexibility is given as- LOW. MODERATE, HIGH
     
In short, we are categorizing the students review of online learning in the form of Flexibility(LOW, MODERATE, HIGH) by applying various classification algorithms like SVM, Decision Tree, XG Boost, ADA Boost, Random Forest, LGM, etc.

So, we got the highest accuracy by Decision Tree Classifier which is 85.4 %.
